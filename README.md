## World Population Data Visualization

This project aims to visualize the world population data from the year 1800 to 2015 using a scatter plot with the fertility rate and life expectancy as the axes. The size of the scatter dots represents the population of each country. The data is extracted from https://www.gapminder.org/data/ and visualized using Python libraries such as seaborn, pandas, pillow, and PIL.
Project Overview

The project uses Python and its libraries to extract, manipulate and visualize data. The following steps were taken to complete the project:

    Data extraction from https://www.gapminder.org/data/
    Data cleaning and processing using pandas
    Data visualization using seaborn
    Animation of the scatter plot using pillow and PIL

## Tools Used

The project utilizes the following tools:

    Python 3.x
    Seaborn
    Pandas
    Pillow
    PIL

## Dependencies

The following packages need to be installed to run the code:

``` pip install seaborn pandas Pillow ```

## Data Visualization

The scatter plot represents the relationship between the fertility rate and life expectancy. The size of the scatter dots represents the population of each country. The animation shows the change in the population over the years from 1800 to 2015.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python and its libraries can be used to extract, clean, and visualize data. The scatter plot provides insights into the relationship between the fertility rate and life expectancy, and the animation shows the change in population over the years. With further development, this project can be extended to include additional data and features.
